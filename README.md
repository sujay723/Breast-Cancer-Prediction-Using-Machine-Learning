# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

A Jupyter notebook-based project to predict breast cancer using machine learning models. The repository includes dataset, model artifacts, and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `Breast Cancer Prediction.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

- `breast_cancer.csv`  
  Dataset used for training and evaluation.

- `brest_cancer.pkl`  
  Pickled trained model (e.g., a scikit-learn classifier).

- `PE_breast_cancer.jpeg`  
  Exploratory plot (e.g., pairplot, distribution plot).

- `roc_breast_cancer.jpeg`  
  ROC curve visualization of model performance.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujay723/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
