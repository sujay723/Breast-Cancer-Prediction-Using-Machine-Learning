# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

A Jupyter notebook-based project to predict breast cancer using machine learning models. The repository includes dataset, model artifacts, and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `Breast Cancer Prediction.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

- `breast_cancer.csv`  
  Dataset used for training and evaluation.

- `brest_cancer.pkl`  
  Pickled trained model (e.g., a scikit-learn classifier).

- `PE_breast_cancer.jpeg`  
  Exploratory plot (e.g., pairplot, distribution plot).

- `roc_breast_cancer.jpeg`  
  ROC curve visualization of model performance.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sujay723/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

## ðŸš€ Usage
## Running the Notebook

1.Open Breast Cancer Prediction.ipynb.

2.Execute cells step by step:

- Load dataset

- Preprocess data (handle missing values, scaling, etc.)

- Train ML models

- Evaluate model performance

- Save trained model (.pkl)



## ðŸ§  Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

The best model (based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC curve) is highlighted in the notebook.


## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy â€“ Overall correctness

Precision â€“ Correct positive predictions

Recall (Sensitivity) â€“ Ability to detect true positives

F1-Score â€“ Balance between precision and recall

ROC Curve & AUC â€“ Overall discriminative power

ðŸ“ˆ ROC curve is included: roc_breast_cancer.jpeg


## ðŸ”® Future Improvements
